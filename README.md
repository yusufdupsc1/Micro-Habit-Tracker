# Micro Habit Tracker

Offline-first habit tracker with full CRUD (localStorage) plus streaks, weekly counts, and export/import.

## Features
- Create, edit, delete habits with category, weekly target, and color tagging.
- Log/undo today's check-in; tracks current/best streaks and weekly totals.
- Data stays local (localStorage) with JSON export/import and full reset.
- Responsive, modern UI using plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Grid/List View Toggle** - Switch between grid and list layouts. Your preference is saved via cookies so it persists across sessions. *(Contributed by [@iamOmarFaruk](https://github.com/iamOmarFaruk))*

## How it can make $100
- Sell for $5–$10 on Gumroad/Itch; 10–20 copies reach $100.
- Bundle with a printable habit journal PDF as an upsell.
- Offer a custom-branded version to a coach or small business for $50–$100.
- Add a tip jar / pay-what-you-want toggle; a few buyers often cover $20–$30.
